      <h1>ADHD</h1>
      <p>
        Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is what we commonly know as
        ADHD. Early diagnosis usually takes place in childhood and often lasts
        into adulthood. ADHD sufferers face trouble paying attention,
        controlling impulsive behaviors (may act without thinking about what the
        result will be), or can even be overly active. There are a series of
        tests to diagnose ADHD just as many other problems, like sleep
        disorders, anxiety, depression, and certain types of learning
        disabilities, can have similar symptoms. One of the most common tests is
        the American Psychiatric Associationâ€™s Diagnostic and Statistical
        Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) .

          There are three different ways ADHD presents itself, depending on
          which types of symptoms are strongest in the individual:
        </h3>

        <li>
          Predominantly Inattentive Presentation: It is hard for the individual
          to organize or finish a task, to pay attention to details, or to
          follow instructions or conversations. The person is easily distracted
          or forgets details of daily routines.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation: The person fidgets
          and talks a lot. It is hard to sit still for long (e.g., for a meal or
          while doing homework). Smaller children may run, jump or climb
          constantly. The individual feels restless and has trouble with
          impulsivity. Someone who is impulsive may interrupt others a lot, grab
          things from people, or speak at inappropriate times. It is hard for
          the person to wait their turn or listen to directions. A person with
          impulsiveness may have more accidents and injuries than others.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Combined Presentation: Symptoms of the above two types are equally
          present in the person.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because symptoms can change over time, the presentation may change over
        time as well. Scientists are studying cause(s) and risk factors in an
        effort to find better ways to manage and reduce the chances of a person
        having ADHD. The cause(s) and risk factors for ADHD are unknown, but
        current research shows that genetics plays an important role. In most
        cases, ADHD is best treated with a combination of behavior therapy and
        medication. For preschool-aged children (4-5 years of age) with ADHD,
        behavior therapy, particularly training for parents, is recommended as
        the first line of treatment before medication is tried. What works best
        can depend on the child and family. Good treatment plans will include
        close monitoring, follow-ups, and making changes, if needed, along the
        way.
